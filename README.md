# Image-Denoising-on-CIFAR-10-Using-Autoencoders
This project focuses on using convolutional autoencoders to perform image denoising on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to remove noise from images while preserving as much of the original image quality as possible.
The CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, is used for training and testing the autoencoder model. The images have been normalized and noise has been added to simulate a real-world scenario of noisy data.
